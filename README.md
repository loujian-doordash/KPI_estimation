# KPI Estimation Project

This repository contains work related to KPI estimation and content optimization algorithms.

## Project Structure

### `/blending/` - Reference Implementation
Contains reference materials from an existing project that demonstrate:
- Ad and Non-Video (NV) content blending algorithms
- Data pipelines for processing sponsored and organic content
- Utility-based ranking optimization
- Performance analysis and visualization

These files serve as reference implementations for understanding:
- Data processing workflows
- Blending algorithm concepts
- Performance measurement approaches
- Code structure and patterns

## Getting Started

This project is currently in development. The reference materials in the `blending/` folder provide examples and patterns that can be adapted for new implementations.

## Repository Organization

- `blending/` - Reference implementations and documentation
- Additional folders and implementations will be added as the project evolves

## Contributing

This is a development repository. Please refer to the reference materials for understanding existing patterns and approaches.
