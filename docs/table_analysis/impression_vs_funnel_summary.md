# üéØ Why You Still Need the Impression Table

## ‚ùå **NO** - Request Funnel Does NOT Include All Impression Table Information

Even though `FACT_ADS_ITEM_REQUEST_FUNNEL` connects to impressions via `IMPRESSION_EVENT_ID`, it **does not contain the actual impression data**. Here's why you need both:

## üìä **What Each Table Provides**

### üîç **IMPRESSION TABLE** (`fact_item_card_view_dedup`) - **USER EXPERIENCE**
**Critical fields your pipeline uses:**
- ‚úÖ `CARD_POSITION` - Where ad appears on page (position 1, 2, 3...)
- ‚úÖ `DD_SESSION_ID` - User session context
- ‚úÖ `RECEIVED_AT` - When user actually saw the ad
- ‚úÖ `STORE_ID` - Which store the impression was for
- ‚úÖ `L1_CATEGORY_ID, L2_CATEGORY_ID` - Product categories
- ‚úÖ `ITEM_ID` - Specific item shown
- ‚úÖ `IS_SPONSORED` - Whether it was an ad
- ‚úÖ `CURRENCY` - Local currency context

### üéØ **REQUEST_FUNNEL** - **AUCTION DECISIONS**
**Critical fields your pipeline uses:**
- ‚úÖ `AD_QUALITY_SCORE` - How good the ad was deemed
- ‚úÖ `EXPECTED_VALUE` - Predicted value of showing this ad
- ‚úÖ `TRUE_BID` - Final bid amount after adjustments
- ‚úÖ `PRICING_METADATA` - Contains `adRank` and reserve prices
- ‚úÖ `AUCTION_OCCURRED_AT` - When auction happened
- ‚úÖ `IMPRESSION_EVENT_ID` - Links to impression table

## üîó **The Key Difference**

```sql
-- REQUEST_FUNNEL has this:
IMPRESSION_EVENT_ID: "5B7FF7A1-0B96-43AF-8"  -- Just the ID!

-- But you need IMPRESSION TABLE to get:
CARD_POSITION: 3                              -- Where it appeared
DD_SESSION_ID: "session_12345"                -- User context  
RECEIVED_AT: "2025-08-04 01:46:38"           -- When user saw it
```

## üí° **Why Both Are Essential for Blending**

### **1. Understanding USER BEHAVIOR** (from impressions):
- **Where** ads appear on the page (`CARD_POSITION`)
- **When** users actually see them (`RECEIVED_AT`)
- **Which sessions** are involved (`DD_SESSION_ID`)

### **2. Understanding AUCTION LOGIC** (from request_funnel):
- **Why** this ad won the auction (`AD_QUALITY_SCORE`)
- **How much** was bid (`TRUE_BID`, `EXPECTED_VALUE`)
- **What ranking** it received (`PRICING_METADATA.adRank`)

### **3. Blending Algorithm Needs BOTH**:
```python
# Your blending algorithm needs:
auction_quality = ad_funnel.AD_QUALITY_SCORE      # From request_funnel
user_position = ad_impression.CARD_POSITION       # From impression table
user_timing = ad_impression.RECEIVED_AT            # From impression table

# To optimize: "Show high-quality ads in good positions at right times"
```

## üìã **Real Example from Your Analysis**

From the successful query results we saw:

| What | Request Funnel | Impression Table |
|------|---------------|------------------|
| **Auction ID** | `68132874-b097-fffb-1` | ‚ùå Not available |
| **Ad Quality** | `AD_QUALITY_SCORE: 0.011` | ‚ùå Not available |
| **True Bid** | `TRUE_BID: 81` | ‚ùå Not available |
| **Card Position** | ‚ùå Not available | `CARD_POSITION: 3` |
| **Session ID** | ‚ùå Not available | `DD_SESSION_ID: session_xyz` |
| **User Timing** | `AUCTION_OCCURRED_AT: 01:46:33` | `RECEIVED_AT: 01:46:38` |

## üéØ **Bottom Line**

**Request funnel = "What happened in the auction"**
**Impression table = "What the user actually experienced"**

**Your blending algorithm needs both** to understand:
1. ‚úÖ **Auction decisions** (quality, bids) ‚Üí From request_funnel
2. ‚úÖ **User experience** (position, timing) ‚Üí From impression table
3. ‚úÖ **The connection** between them ‚Üí Via `IMPRESSION_EVENT_ID`

This is why your `ad data pipeline.py` does the join:
```sql
SELECT 
  ad_funnel.AD_QUALITY_SCORE,    -- Auction logic
  ad_funnel.TRUE_BID,            -- Auction logic  
  ad_imp.*                       -- User experience
FROM FACT_ADS_ITEM_REQUEST_FUNNEL ad_funnel
LEFT JOIN ad_impression ad_imp
  ON ad_imp.IMPRESSION_EVENT_ID = ad_funnel.IMPRESSION_EVENT_ID
```

**Without the impression table, you'd have auction data but no user context!**
